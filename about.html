        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Over the years, I have primarily worked on interdisciplinary AI. During the onset of the pandemic in 2020, I worked at the MIT PathCheck Foundation as a Software Developer. I worked on using statistical modelling to study the spread of COVID-19 in different countries and the efficacy of different governmental measures. I also led a research team of 20 to analyze global COVID control and monetary strategies as well as the vaccination credential issued by various countries.</p>
        <p>In addition, I interned at IBM Research in May 2021. I worked with IBM researchers and psychologists from EmancipAction - a foundation in Mumbai, India, that homes victims of human trafficking. I contributed towards building an AI-assisted framework, powered by IBM Watson, that allows young girls at Emancipation to converse with a mental health chatbot in Hindi, English, and Kannada.</p>
        <p>Moreover, I worked at the NVIDIA AI Lab with Prof. Anima Anandkumar and Prof. Kamyar Azizzadenesheli on using neural operators for Functional Ultrasound Imaging. I was working on developing a novel algorithm using Partial Differential Equations to learn power Doppler reconstruction functions.</p>
